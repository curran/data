<h2>
Darwin's Heights of Cross- and Self-fertilized Zea May Pairs
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Darwin (1876) studied the growth of pairs of zea may (aka corn)
seedlings, one produced by cross-fertilization and the other
produced by self-fertilization, but otherwise grown under identical 
conditions.
His goal was to demonstrate the greater vigour of the cross-fertilized plants.
The data recorded are the final height (inches, to the nearest 1/8th)  of the plants in each pair.
</p>
<p>In the <EM>Design of Experiments</EM>, Fisher (1935) used these data to illustrate
a paired t-test (well, a one-sample test on the mean difference, <code>cross - self</code>).
Later in the book (section 21), he used this data to illustrate an early example of a non-parametric permutation
test, treating each paired difference as having (randomly) either a positive or negative sign. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(ZeaMays)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 15 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>pair</code></dt><dd><p>pair number, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pot</code></dt><dd><p>pot, a factor with levels <code>1</code> <code>2</code> <code>3</code> <code>4</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cross</code></dt><dd><p>height of cross fertilized plant, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>self</code></dt><dd><p>height of cross fertilized plant, a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>diff</code></dt><dd><p><code>cross - self</code> for each pair</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In addition to the standard paired t-test,
several types of non-parametric tests can be contemplated:
</p>
<p>(a) Permutation test, where the values of, say <code>self</code> are permuted and <code>diff=cross - self</code>
is calculated for each permutation.  There are 15! permutations, but a reasonably
large number of random permutations would suffice.  But this doesn't take the paired samples
into account.
</p>
<p>(b) Permutation test based on assigning each <code>abs(diff)</code> a + or - sign, and calculating the mean(diff).
There are <i>2^{15}</i> such possible values.  This is essentially what Fisher 
proposed.  The p-value for the test is the proportion of absolute mean differences
under such randomization which exceed the observed mean difference.
</p>
<p>(c) Wilcoxon signed rank test: tests the hypothesis that the median signed rank of the <code>diff</code> is zero,
or that the distribution of <code>diff</code> is symmetric about 0, vs. a location shifted alternative.
</p>
