<h2> Electricity from Wave Power at Sea </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Measurements of root mean square bending moment by two different mooring
methods.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data("waves")</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 18 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>method1</dt><dd><p>Root mean square bending moment in Newton metres, mooring method 1</p>
</dd>
<dt>method2</dt><dd><p>Root mean square bending moment in Newton metres, mooring method 2</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a design study for a device to generate electricity from
wave power at sea, experiments were carried out on scale models
in a wave tank to establish how the choice of mooring method
for the system affected the bending stress produced in part of
the device. The wave tank could simulate a wide range of sea
states and the model system was subjected to the same sample 
of sea states with each of two mooring methods, one of which    
was considerably cheaper than the other.
The question of interest is whether bending stress differs
for the two mooring methods.
