<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The first combined Olympic event for women was the pentathlon,
first held in Germany in 1928. Initially this consisted of the
shot putt, long jump, 100m, high jump and javelin events held
over two days. The pentathlon was first introduced into the Olympic
Games in 1964, when it consisted of the 80m hurdles, shot, high
jump, long jump and 200m. In 1977 the 200m was replaced by the
800m and from 1981 the IAAF brought in the seven-event heptathlon
in place of the pentathlon, with day one containing the events-100m
hurdles, shot, high jump, 200m and day two, the long jump, javelin
and 800m. A scoring system is used to assign points to the results
from each event and the winner is the woman who accumulates the
most points over the two days. The event made its first Olympic
appearance in 1984.
</p>
<p>In the 1988 Olympics held in Seoul, the heptathlon was won
by one of the stars of women's athletics in the USA, Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
The results for all 25 competitors are given here.
