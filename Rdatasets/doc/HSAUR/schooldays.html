<p>The data arise from a sociological study
of Australian Aboriginal and white children reported by
Quine (1975).
</p>
<p>In this study, children of both sexes from four age groups
(final grade in primary schools and first, second and third form  
in secondary school) and from two cultural groups were used.
The children in age group were classified as slow or average 
learners. The response variable was the number of days absent   
from school during the school year. (Children who had suffered
a serious illness during the years were excluded.)
