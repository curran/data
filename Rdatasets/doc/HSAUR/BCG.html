<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) is the most widely used vaccination
in the world. Developed in the 1930s and made of a live, weakened
strain of Mycobacterium bovis, the BCG is the only vaccination
available against tuberculosis today. Colditz et al. (1994)
report  data from 13 clinical trials of BCG vaccine each investigating   
its efficacy in the treatment of tuberculosis. The number of subjects 
suffering from TB with or without BCG vaccination are 
given here. 
In addition, the data contains the values of two other 
variables for each study, namely, the geographic latitude of
the place where the study was undertaken and the year of publication.
These two variables will be used to investigate and perhaps explain
any heterogeneity among the studies.
