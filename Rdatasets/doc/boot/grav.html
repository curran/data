Acceleration Due to Gravity
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>gravity</code> data frame has 81 rows and 2 columns.
</p>
<p>The <code>grav</code> data set has 26 rows and 2 columns.
</p>
<p>Between May 1934 and July 1935, the National Bureau of Standards in
Washington D.C. conducted a series of experiments to estimate the
acceleration due to gravity, <EM>g</EM>, at Washington.  Each experiment
produced a number of replicate estimates of <EM>g</EM> using the same
methodology.  Although the basic method remained the same for all
experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were changes in
configuration.
</p>
<p>The <code>gravity</code> data frame contains the data from all eight
experiments.  The <code>grav</code> data frame contains the data from the
experiments 7 and 8.  The data are expressed as deviations from 980.000
in centimetres per second squared.
