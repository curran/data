Genetic Links to Left-handedness
--------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``claridge`` data frame has 37 rows and 2 columns.

The data are from an experiment which was designed to look for a
relationship between a certain genetic characteristic and handedness.
The 37 subjects were women who had a son with mental retardation due to
inheriting a defective X-chromosome. For each such mother a genetic
measurement of their DNA was made. Larger values of this measurement are
known to be linked to the defective gene and it was hypothesized that
larger values might also be linked to a progressive shift away from
right-handednesss. Each woman also filled in a questionnaire regarding
which hand they used for various tasks. From these questionnaires a
measure of hand preference was found for each mother. The scale of this
measure goes from 1, indicating someone who always favours their right
hand, to 8, indicating someone who always favours their left hand.
Between these two extremes are people who favour one hand for some tasks
and the other for other tasks.
