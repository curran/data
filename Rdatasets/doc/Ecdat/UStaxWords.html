<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Thousands of words in the US tax code and federal tax regulations,
1955-2005.  This is based on data from the Tax Foundation
(taxfoundation.org), adjusted to eliminate an obvious questionable
observation in <code>otherTaxRegulations</code> for 1965.  This series was
not reported directly by the Tax Foundation but is easily computed as
the difference between their Income and Entire tax numbers.  This
series  shows the numbers falling by 48 percent between 1965 and 1975
and by 1.5 percent between 1995 and 2005.  These are the only declines
seen in these numbers and seem inconsistent with the common concern
(expressed e.g., in Moody, Warcholik and Hodge, 2005) about the
difficulties of simplifying any governmental program, because vested
interest appear to defend almost anything.
</p>
<p>The decline of 48 percent seems more curious for two additional
reasons:  First, it was preceeded by a tripling of
<code>otherTaxRegulations</code> between 1955 and 1965.  Second, it was NOT
accompanied by any comparable behavior of <code>otherTaxCode</code>.
Instead, the latter grew each decade by between 17 and 53 percent,
similar to but slower than the growth in <code>IncomeTaxCode</code> and
<code>IncomeTaxRegulations</code>.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, <code>otherTaxRegulations</code> for 1965 is replaced by the
average of the numbers for 1955 and 1975, and
<code>EntireTaxRegulations</code> for 1965 is comparably adjusted.  This
replaces (1322, 2960) for those two variables for 1965 with (565,
2203).  In addition, <code>otherTaxCodeAndRegs</code> and
<code>EntireTaxCodeAndRegulations</code> are also changed from (1626, 3507)
to (870, 2751).
</p>
<p>Independent of whether this adjustment is correct or not, it's clear
that there have been roughly 3 words of regulations for each word in
the tax code.  Most of these are income tax regulations, which have
recently contained 4.5 words for every word in code.  The income tax
code currently includes roughly 50 percent more words than other tax
code.

# Note especially the anomalous behaviour of line 4 =
# otherTaxRegulations.  As noted with "details" above,
# otherTaxRegulations could have tripled between 1955 and 1965,
# then fallen by 48 percent between 1965 and 1975.  However,
# that does not seem credible, especially since there was no
# corresponding behavior in otherTaxCode.
