Official Secrecy of the United States Government 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on classification activity of the United States government.  
</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick (2013) notes that the dramatic jump in derivative classification activity (<code>DerivClassActivity</code>) that occurred in 2009 coincided with &quot;New guidance issued to include electronic environment&quot;.  Apart from the jump in 2009, the <code>DerivClassActivity</code> tended to increase by roughly 12 percent per year (with a standard deviation of the increase in the natural logarithm of <code>DerivClassActivity</code> of 0.18).  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data(USclassifiedDocuments)
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataframe containing :
</p>

<dl>
<dt>year</dt><dd>
<p>the calendar year 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>OCAuthority</dt><dd>
<p>Number of people in the government designated as Original Classification Authorities for the indicated <code>year</code>.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>OCActivity</dt><dd>
<p>Original classification activity for the indicated year:  These are the number of documents created with an original classification, i.e., so designated by an official Original Classification Authority.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>TenYearDeclass</dt><dd>
<p>Percent of <code>OCActivity</code> covered by the 10 year declassification rules.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>DerivClassActivity</dt><dd>
<p>Derivative classification activity for the indicated year:  
These are the number of documents created that claim another 
document as the authority for classification.  
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
    


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The lag 1 autocorrrelation of the first difference of the 
logarithms of <code>DerivClassActivity</code> through 2008 is 
<code>-0.52</code>.  However, because there are only 13 numbers 
(12 differences), this negative correlation is not statistically 
significant.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
##
## 1.  plot DerivClassActivity 
##
plot(DerivClassActivity~year, USclassifiedDocuments)
#  Exponential growth?  

plot(DerivClassActivity~year, USclassifiedDocuments, 
     log='y')
# A jump in 2009 as discussed by Fitzpatrick (2013).  
# Otherwise plausibly a straight line.   

##
## 2.  First difference? 
##
plot(diff(log(DerivClassActivity))~year[-1], 
     USclassifiedDocuments)
# Jump in 2009 but otherwise on distribution 

##
## 3.  autocorrelation?  
##
sel &lt;- with(USclassifiedDocuments, 
            (1995 &lt; year) &amp; (year &lt; 2009) )
acf(diff(log(USclassifiedDocuments$
             DerivClassActivity[sel])))
# lag 1 autocorrelation = (-0.52).  
# However, with only 12 numbers, 
# this is not statistically significant.
