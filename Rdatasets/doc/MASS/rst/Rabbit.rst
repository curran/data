Blood Pressure in Rabbits
-------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Five rabbits were studied on two occasions, after treatment with saline
(control) and after treatment with the *5-HT\_3* antagonist MDL 72222.
After each treatment ascending doses of phenylbiguanide were injected
intravenously at 10 minute intervals and the responses of mean blood
pressure measured. The goal was to test whether the cardiogenic
chemoreflex elicited by phenylbiguanide depends on the activation of
*5-HT\_3* receptors.
