Six Mental Tests
----------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

These data are from the SAS manual and consist of six mental tests for
32 students, with some missing data. The three ``x`` variables are
intended to load on a verbal factor, and the three ``y`` variables on a
math factor. The data can be used to illustrate the estimation of a
confirmatory factor analysis model by multinormal full-information
maximum-likelihood in the presence of missing data.
