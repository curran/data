<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In November 1993, the state of Pennsylvania conducted
elections for its state legislature. The result in the Senate election
in the 2nd district (based in Philadelphia) was challenged in court,
and ultimately overturned. The Democratic candidate won 19,127 of
the votes cast by voting machine, while the Republican won 19,691
votes cast by voting machine, giving the Republican a lead of 564
votes. However, the Democrat won 1,396 absentee ballots, while the
Republican won just 371 absentee ballots, more than offsetting the
Republican lead based on the votes recorded by machines on election
day. The Republican candidate sued, claiming that many of the absentee
ballots were fraudulent. The judge in the case solicited expert
analysis from Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton
University. Ashenfelter examined the relationship between absentee
vote margins and machine vote margins in 21 previous Pennsylvania
Senate elections in seven districts in the Philadelphia area over the
preceding decade.</p>
