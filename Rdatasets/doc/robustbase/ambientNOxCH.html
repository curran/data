<h2> Daily Means of NOx (mono-nitrogen oxides) in air</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains daily means (from midnight to midnight) of NOx,
i.e., mono-nitrogen oxides, in [ppb] at 13 sites in central
Switzerland and Aarau for the year 2004.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(ambientNOxCH)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 366 observations on the following 14 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>date</code></dt><dd><p>date of day, of class <code>"Date"</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ad</code></dt><dd><p>Site is located north of Altdorf 100 meters east of
motorway A2, on an open field at the beginning of a more than
2000m deep valley (690.175, 193.55; 438; inLuft)</p>

the lake of Lucerne on an alp with half a dozen small houses

35m above and 250m south of motorway A14 from Zug to Lucerne on a
low hill with free 360° panorama (665.5, 213.41; 484; inLuft).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>si</code></dt><dd><p>Site is located at the border of a small industrial
area in Sisseln, 300 m east of a main road (640.725, 266.25; 305;
inLuft).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>st</code></dt><dd><p>Site is located at the south east border of Stans

</dd>
<dt><code>su</code></dt><dd><p>Site is located in the center of Suhr (8700
inhabitants), 10 m from the main road (648.49, 246.985; 403; inLuft).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sz</code></dt><dd><p>Site is located in Schwyz (14'200 inhabitants) near
a shopping center (691.92, 208.03; 470; inLuft).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>zg</code></dt><dd><p>Site is located in the centre of Zug with 22'000
inhabitants, 24 m from the main road (681.625, 224.625; 420;
inLuft).</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The 13 sites are part of one of the three air quality monitoring networks:
inLuft (regional authorities of central Switzerland and canton Aargau)
<br>
NABEL (Swiss federal network)
<br>
MFM-U (Monitoring flankierende Massnahmen Umwelt), special Swiss
federal network along transit motorways A2 and A13 from Germany to
Italy through Switzerland
<br>
The information within the brackets means: Swiss
coordinates km east, km north; m above sea level; network
</p>
<p>When the measuring sites are exposed to the same atmospheric condition
and when there is no singular emission event at any site,
<code>log(mean(NOx) of a specific day at each site)</code> is a linear
function of <code>log(yearly.mean(NOx) at the corresponding site)</code>. The
offset and the slope of the straight
line reflects the atmospheric conditions at this specific day. During
winter time, often an inversion prevents the emissions from being
diluted vertically, so that there evolve two separate atmospheric
compartements: One below the inversion boundary with polluted air and one
above with relatively clean air. In our example below, Rigi Seebodenalp
is above the inversion boundary between December 10th and 12th.
