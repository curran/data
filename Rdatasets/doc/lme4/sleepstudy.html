<h2>Reaction times in a sleep deprivation study</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The average reaction time per day for subjects in a sleep
deprivation study. On day 0 the subjects had their normal
amount of sleep.  Starting that night they were
restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night.  The
observations represent the average reaction time on a
series of tests given each day to each subject.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 180 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Reaction</code></dt><dd><p>Average reaction time (ms)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Days</code></dt><dd><p>Number of days of sleep deprivation</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Subject</code></dt><dd><p>Subject number on which the observation was made.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are from the study described in Belenky et al.
(2003), for the sleep-deprived group and for the first 10
days of the study, up to the recovery period.
