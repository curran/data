<h2>Variation in penicillin testing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Six samples of penicillin were tested using the <EM>B.
subtilis</EM> plate method on each of 24 plates.  The
response is the diameter (mm) of the zone of inhibition
of growth of the organism.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 144 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>diameter</code></dt><dd><p>diameter (mm) of the zone of inhibition of
the growth of the organism.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>plate</code></dt><dd><p>assay plate.  A factor with levels &lsquo;a&rsquo; to
&lsquo;x&rsquo;.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sample</code></dt><dd><p>penicillin sample.  A factor with levels
&lsquo;A&rsquo; to &lsquo;F&rsquo;.</p>
</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are described in Davies and Goldsmith (1972) as
coming from an investigation to &ldquo;assess the
variability between samples of penicillin by the <EM>B.
subtilis</EM> method.  In this test method a bulk-inoculated
nutrient agar medium is poured into a Petri dish of
approximately 90 mm. diameter, known as a plate.  When
the medium has set, six small hollow cylinders or pots
(about 4 mm. in diameter) are cemented onto the surface
at equally spaced intervals.  A few drops of the
penicillin solutions to be compared are placed in the
respective cylinders, and the whole plate is placed in an
incubator for a given time.  Penicillin diffuses from the
pots into the agar, and this produces a clear circular
zone of inhibition of growth of the organisms, which can
be readily measured.  The diameter of the zone is related
in a known way to the concentration of penicillin in the
solution.&rdquo;
